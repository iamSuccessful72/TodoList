    <meta name="description" content="My todo list app is like every other todo list app but with a bit more details to help the user add more details
    and like every other todo app the user gets some interactive functionalities, the user can toggle the status of their task, delete tasks, and also you have
    your task saved on your local browser storage so no need to worry when you close the application you still have your task saved, and also you can filter tasks
    that's pretty much it thanks enjoy." />
